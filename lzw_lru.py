LZW Compression Tool (LRU Mode)

Implements LZW compression with the "LRU" (Least Recently Used) policy:
when the dictionary reaches maximum size, it evicts the least recently
used entry to make room for new entries.

Data Structure:
- Doubly-linked list + HashMap for O(1) LRU operations
- head.next = most recently used (MRU)
- tail.prev = least recently used (LRU)
- Sentinel head/tail nodes eliminate edge cases

Usage:
    Compress:   python3 LZW-LRU.py compress input.txt output.lzw --alphabet ascii
    Decompress: python3 LZW-LRU.py decompress input.lzw output.txt
