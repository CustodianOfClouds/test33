[ENCODE] Output code 0 for phrase 'a' (bits=3)
[DICT] Added 'ab' -> 3 (dict_size=3)
[ENCODE] Output code 1 for phrase 'b' (bits=3)
[DICT] Added 'ba' -> 4 (dict_size=4)
[ENCODE] Output code 3 for phrase 'ab' (bits=3)
[LRU] Updated 'ab' as recently used
[DICT] Added 'aba' -> 5 (dict_size=5)
[ENCODE] Output code 5 for phrase 'aba' (bits=3)
