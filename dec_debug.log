Alphabet: ['a', 'b']
Alphabet size: 2, EOF_CODE: 2

Initial dictionary: {0: 'a', 1: 'b'}

[DECODE] Read code 0 -> 'a' (bits=3)
[DECODE] Read code 1 -> 'b' (bits=3)
[DICT] Added 3 -> 'ab' (dict_size=3)
[DECODE] Read code 3 -> 'ab' (bits=3)
[DICT] Added 4 -> 'ba' (dict_size=4)
[LRU] Updated code 3 as recently used
[DECODE] Read code 5 (SPECIAL CASE: next_code) -> 'aba' (bits=3)
[DICT] Added 5 -> 'aba' (dict_size=5)
[LRU] Updated code 5 as recently used
[DECODE] Read code 4 -> 'ba' (bits=3)
[DICT] Added 6 -> 'abab' (dict_size=6)
[LRU] Updated code 4 as recently used
[DECODE] Read code 7 (SPECIAL CASE: next_code) -> 'bab' (bits=3)
[DICT] Added 7 -> 'bab' (dict_size=7)
[LRU] Updated code 7 as recently used
[BITS] Increased from 3 to 4 bits (next_code=8, threshold=16)
[DECODE] Read code 6 -> 'abab' (bits=4)
[DICT] Added 8 -> 'baba' (dict_size=8)
[LRU] Updated code 6 as recently used
[DECODE] Read code 6 -> 'abab' (bits=4)
